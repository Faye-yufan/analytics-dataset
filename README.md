Analytic generation of datasets with specified statistical characteristics.

# Introduction
analytics-dataset provides a set of functionality to enable the specification and generation of a wide range of datasets with specified statistical characteristics. Specification to include the predictor matrix and the response vector. Check the [analyticsdf documentation](https://faye-yufan.github.io/analytics-dataset/) for more details.
Examples include:
* High correlation and multi-collinearity among predictor variables
* Interaction effects between variables
* Skewed distributions of predictor and response variables
* Nonlinear relationships between predictor and response variables

## Research existing automate dataset functionality
